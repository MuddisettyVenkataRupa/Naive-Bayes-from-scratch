# Naive-Bayes-from-scratch

Implemented using Pandas, Scikit-Learn. Comparison among different naive bayes inbuilt algorithms such as Multinomial, Categorical, Gaussian Naive Bayes with Multinomial Naive Bayes using pandas


## OBSERVATIONS:
       Among all, Categorical Naive Bayes of Scikit-Learn gave good results because Titanic dataset is having more categorical than continuous variables.
